# ATLASproject
This code uses both object oriented selection criteria and a NN to sort through ATLAS data. Comparing the results from both techniques provides evidence for a neural-network being superior at extracting events with a high probability of being events of interest.
The results from this project can be used in the search for the existence of supersymmetric leptons.
