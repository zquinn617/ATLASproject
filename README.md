# ATLAS Project
This code uses both object selection criteria and a NN to sort through the ATLAS LHC 13 Tev 2016 data set. 
The results from this project can be used in the search for the existence of supersymmetric leptons.
Comparing the results from both techniques provides evidence for a neural-network being superior at extracting events of interest from ATLAS data sets.
